\title{Computing the noise variance in a high-dimensional linear model}
\usage{
dicker_noise_sd(W, z)
}
\arguments{
\item{W}{design matrix for high-dimensional linear model}

\item{z}{response in a high-dimensional linear model}

\item{return}{a nonnegative scalar of estimated noise standard deviation}
}
\description{
Assume data are generated from the model z = W beta + e, where e has independent components N(0, sigma^2), we estimate sigma^2 by using the method in Dicker (2014).
